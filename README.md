## FAQs

### The remote state isn't updating, what do I do?

If the CI process appears to be stuck with a stale `tf state` then run the following command to force a refresh:

```
terragrunt refresh
```
If the CI process is still failing after a refresh look for errors about items no longer available in AWS - say something that was deleted manually via the AWS console or CLI.
To explicitly delete the stale resource from TF state use the following command below. *Note:*```terragrunt state rm``` will not delete the resource from AWS it will unlink it from state only.

```shell
terragrunt state rm aws_resource_name
```
